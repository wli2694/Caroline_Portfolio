          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>In 24 hours, design and develop an iPhone app that allows Type 1 Diabetes patients to easily and effectively manage their diet, physical activity, and medications in order to keep their blood glucose tightly controlled.</p>

          <p>My major contributions were researching Type 1 Diabetes, creating wireframes and the UI design, and developing the logging function, carb-counting game, and insulin calculator. My team members focused on programming the food finder that searches for nearby restaurants and cafes and presents a list of foods sorted by carbohydrate amount.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - RESEARCH -->
      <div class="projectgray">

          <h2>Research &amp; Ideation</h2>
          <p>To gain a better understanding of our target users, I researched management of Type 1 Diabetes, interviews of patients with Type 1 Diabetes, and existing Diabetes applications.</p>

          <p>To come up with our idea, we first met a few days before the event and discussed our background, skills, and ideas for an app related to health and data. From many of the digital health articles I have read online and a previous discussion with an endocrinologist, I knew that there were many apps for Type 2 Diabetes patients but not for Type 1 Diabetes patients. In addition, even with all the apps available, there are still few apps that cover all aspects of diabetes management. We decided to pursue this topic and create a virtual assistant for Type 1 Diabetes patients.</p>

          <h2>UI Design</h2>
          <p>With only 24 hours to design and develop the entire app, we were only able to some quick wireframing and discussion. I later went back and created new wireframes in order to design an improved user interface.</p>

          <h3>Wireframing</h3>

          <h3>Med-Fi Prototyping</h3>
          <p>After the event, I went back and redesigned the user interface for the app using Sketch 3. I focused on a simple but pleasant and consistent design and made sure to emphasize the most important points of each screen so it was clear which areas could be interacted with.</p>

          <h2>Development in Xcode and Swift</h2>
          <p>We then proceeded to separate the app into different components for each of us to program into Xcode. We used Github to share materials. Finally, we presented our final prototype to the judges!</p>
