          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>In 24 hours, our goal was to design and develop an iPhone app that allows <strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong> patients to easily and effectively manage their diet, physical activity, and medications in order to keep their blood glucose tightly controlled.</p>

          <p>My major contributions were <strong>researching Type 1 Diabetes, creating wireframes and the UI design, and developing</strong> the logging function, carb-counting game, and insulin calculator. My team members focused on programming the food finder that searches for nearby restaurants and cafes and presents a list of foods sorted by carbohydrate amount.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - RESEARCH -->
      <div class="projectgray">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Research &amp; Ideation</h2>
          <p>To gain a better understanding of our target users, I researched <strong>management of Type 1 Diabetes, interviews of patients with Type 1 Diabetes, and existing Diabetes applications</strong>.</p>

          <p>To come up with our idea, we first met a few days before the event and discussed our background, skills, and ideas for an app related to health and data. From many of the digital health articles I have read online and a previous discussion with an endocrinologist, I knew that there were <strong>many apps for Type 2 Diabetes patients but not for Type 1 Diabetes patients</strong>. In addition, even with all the apps available, there are still few apps that cover all aspects of diabetes management. We decided to pursue this topic and create a virtual assistant for Type 1 Diabetes patients.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - WIREFRAMING AND UI DESIGN -->
      <div class="projectwhite">

          <h2>UI Design</h2>
          <p>With only 24 hours to design and develop the entire app, we were only able to some <strong>quick wireframing and discussion</strong>. I later went back and created new wireframes in order to design an improved user interface.</p>

          <h3>Wireframing</h3>

          <h3>Med-Fi Prototyping</h3>
          <p>After the event, I went back and redesigned the user interface for the app using <strong>Sketch</strong>. I focused on a simple but pleasant and consistent design and made sure to emphasize the most important points of each screen so it was clear which areas could be interacted with.</p>

      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Development in Xcode and Swift</h2>
          <p>We then proceeded to separate the app into different components for each of us to program into <strong>Xcode</strong>. We used Github to share materials. Finally, we presented our final prototype to the judges!</p>
