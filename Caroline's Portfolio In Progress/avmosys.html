          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>My team's goal was to design and develop a mobile version of AVMOSYS, Argus's current web application for aviation management. This software allows business aviation professionals such as <strong>sales representatives, scheduler, and operations managers</strong> to calculate trip quotes and schedule <strong>and coordinate highly complex and customized trips</strong> for clients.</p>
          <p>My goal was to guide the design process to <strong>optimize user experience</strong> and design the <strong>user interface</strong> for the app.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - RESEARCH -->
      <div class="projectgray">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>My first step was to <strong>get to know my team</strong> and understand the structure of the company. I did this by meeting with different coworkers and asking questions. I also attended a few orientation sessions on the history of AVMOSYS and business aviation.</p>

          <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
          <p>I met with the leaders of my team and the company CIO and asked many questions about the <strong>goals of the project, their ideas and visions for the project, and current and expected challenges</strong>. I also asked about their expections of me.</p>

          <h3>Learning the Current Software</h3>
          <p>To better understand the application I would be helping to design, I spent a few days going through every single tab, page, field, and button in the curent web application and evaluating the design and usability. I printed screenshots and wrote notes on the pages.</p>

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>I met with the Customer Experience Manager on my team to gain insights about the customer complaints and needs. I was able to determine the primary user group through speaking with her - <strong>Aviation Schedulers</strong>.</p>
          <p>The following month, I visited one of Argus's clients and <strong>interviewed sales representatives, schedulers, and operations managers</strong>. I observed them carrying out their normal work processes.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - DESIGN -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>I then began to <strong>sketch ideas</strong> for the mobile interface and then <strong>created wireframes</strong> for particular functions. I shared my designs and received feedback from the team at our daily meetings. My main goal at this point was to create as many ideas as possible to <strong>encourage discussion and creativity</strong> among team members.</p>

          <h3>Interactive Mockups</h3>
          <p>Using <strong>Sketch</strong>, I created higher-fidelity mockups and added interactivity with <strong>InvisionApp</strong> to allow team members to test the usability of our team's ideas and to give an idea of the direction we plan to take to other employees at the company.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, the developers began to work on building the parts of the application we decided on as a team.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 4 - CONCLUSION -->
      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Overall this has been an extremely valuable and exciting experience for me. The members of my team were all such <strong>amazing and fun people</strong> who respected each others' opinions and loved to communicate openly and bounce ideas off of each other. I think I have been very lucky to work in this environment.</p>

          <p>A few of the challenges included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Business aviation</strong> - a highly complex field with many meticulous tasks and expectaitons</li>
            <li><strong>Differences in opinion</strong> within argus about design and approach for AVMOSYS</li>
            <li>Being an <strong>entry-level designer</strong> but also the only designer in the company</li>
            <li><strong>Explaining design topics</strong> and topics to co-workers unfamiliar with design</li>
          </ul>
