          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>Following the emerging trend of telemedicine, Dr. Win planned to start a virtual clinic where he would see patients through video conference call for minor ailments such as colds or chronic disease management. Since I was already a Billing Assistant as his office, I volunteered to design and develop an informational website for this clinic that would also serve a central portal for patients to access forms and their electronic medical record.</p>

          <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
          <p>First I spent a lot of time speaking with Dr. Win and the office manager about their ideas and goals for the website. They primarily wanted a simple informational website for patients to be able to find Dr. Win and learn about his services.</p>

          <p>Next, I planned out the organization of the website and key information to focus on. I clarified specific details with Dr. Win and the Office Manager, sketched a few different concepts, and wrote down notes on ways to organize the website.</p>

          <h2>Mockups &amp; Development</h2>

          <p>Before designing the full-color version of the website, I created some wireframes of the general layout for the website. I then designed the colored version using Sketch. After verifying the final design with Dr. Win and the Office Manager, I programmed the website with HTML and CSS and made it responsive so that patients could view the website easily from any device.</p>
