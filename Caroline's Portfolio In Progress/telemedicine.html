          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>Following the <strong>emerging trend of telemedicine</strong>, Dr. Win, an internal medicine physician, planned to start a virtual clinic where he would see patients through video conference call for minor ailments such as colds or chronic disease management. Since I was already a Billing Assistant as his office, I volunteered to design and develop an informational website for this clinic that would also serve a central portal for patients.</p>
          <p>My primary goal was to create a <strong>website for patients with minor ailments or chronic diseases</strong> to learn about Dr. Winâ€™s virtual clinic, schedule a convenient virtual appointment with Dr. Win, access forms, and view their appointments and electronicmedical record.</p>

          <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
          <p>First I spent a lot of time speaking with <strong>Dr. Win and the office manager</strong> about their ideas and goals for the website. They primarily wanted a simple informational website for patients to be able to find Dr. Win and learn about his services.</p>

          <p>Next, I planned out the <strong>organization of the website and key information</strong> to focus on. I clarified specific details with Dr. Win and the Office Manager, sketched a few different concepts, and wrote down notes on ways to organize the website.</p>

          <h2>Mockups &amp; Development</h2>

          <p>Before designing the high-fidelity design of the website, I created some <strong>wireframes</strong> of the general layout for the website. I then designed the high-fidelity version using <strong>Sketch</strong>. After verifying the final design with Dr. Win and the Office Manager, I programmed the website with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> and made it responsive so that patients could view the website easily from any device.</p>
