          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>uReveal’s data-mining software allows a user to index and search multiple sources including private databases and public newsfeeds and create specialized dictionaries of synonyms. As the software is sold mostly to investigative agencies like NCIS, uReveal asked us to explore additional markets and applications of their technology. Our team focused on academic researchers as our primary user group.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>How might we apply data-mining technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of academic researchers in their daily work?</p>

          <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
          <p>Our first step was to conduct interviews to better understand the values, goals, and pain points of our primary user group: academic researchers.</p>

          <h3>Interviews with Academic Researchers</h3>
          <p>U1. Business &amp; Economics Librarian</p>
          <p>U2. HCI Professor</p>
          <p>U3. Post-Doctoral Fellow in HCI</p>

          <p>We created interview protocols and met with each participant for 30 minutes, asking questions such as “Tell me about the last time you searched for information on your research topic,” and “Can you think of a situation when you were unable to find information you were looking for?” We also observed the participants as they worked.</p>
          <p>All interviewees signed consent forms.</p>

            <div class="twothird">
              <p>We then met for 6 hours as a team and utilized Karen Holtzblatt’s techniques to recount the interviews, note down key findings, and create sequence-flow models for each interviewee.</p>

          <h4>Primary Pain Points for Academics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Need to be aware of hundreds of databases and resources, which are variable in quality and usability</li>
            <li>Some databases do not allow the user to download information</li>
            <li>Specific papers are difficult to find because Google does not sort by field</li>
            <li>News aggregators do not usually provide enough information</li>
            <li>Storing and organizing all sources is a tedious process</li>
            <li>Important information can be missed if proper search terms are not used</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Affinity Diagramming</h2>
          <p>Taking our 150+ notes, we began to group them into affinity clusters.</p>

          <img src="images/uresearch/affinitydiagram.png" alt="affinity diagram" class="projectimg">

          <h3>Affinity Clusters</h3>

          <h4>Collaborative &amp; High Quality</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Collaboration plays an important role throughout my research process.</li>
            <li>I need tools that enable me to easily share info, collect feedback, and work with others.</li>
            <li>I perform time-consuming analyses of text by hand because I do not trust technical solutions.</li>
            <li>I want to ensure my research introduces new ideas and adds value.</li>
            <li>It is important for me to keep up with my field. I do this via communicating with colleagues, reading papers, and skimming sites.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Efficient</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I want a more efficient way of organizing my work and resources.</li>
            <li>I don’t have enough time to keep up with the frontier and also maintain a good work-life balance.</li>
            <li>I want to easily capture key points from a large quantity of literature.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Powerful, Intuitive &amp; Customizable</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students are learning to do research and want tools that are easy to access and understand.</li>
            <li>I don’t believe current search tools are powerful or customizable enough.</li>
            <li>I want credible databases with a large quantity of data.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Synthesis &amp; Analysis</h2>
          <p>We then combined our individual sequence-flow models into a consolidated sequence-flow model and a cultural model. </p>

      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Final Proposal: uResearch</h2>
          <p>Carma is a mobile app that allows tweens to get rides from pre-approved drivers in the community such as friends’ parents, family friends, and sibilings in exchange for donig good deeds and chores for these drivers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides transportation for tweens</li>
            <li>Incentivizes drivers by letting them request favors or help with chores</li>
            <li>Encourages tweens to take responsibility by doing good deeds and thus building “carma”</li>
            <li>Parents stay in control by approving the trip details and good deeds</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Final Poster Presentation to Client</h3>
          <p>As our team continued to discuss different ideas, we discovered an underlying theme: tween’s parents need not necessarily be the ones to drive or coordinate. Instead, there can be a pool of trusted drivers for minors who transport tweens in exchange for credits. We presented the 3 most promising scenarios as storyboards to our class to elicit feedback.</p>
