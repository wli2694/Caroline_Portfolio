          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>uReveal’s data-mining software allows a user to <strong>index and search multiple sources</strong> including private databases and public newsfeeds and create specialized dictionaries of synonyms. As the software is sold mostly to investigative agencies like NCIS, uReveal asked us to <strong>explore additional markets and applications</strong> of their technology. Our team focused on <strong>academic researchers</strong> as our primary user group.</p>

          <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
          <p>Our first step was to conduct interviews to better understand the values, goals, and pain points of our primary user group: <strong>academic researchers</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Interviews with Academic Researchers</h3>
          <p>We created interview protocols and met with each participant for 30 minutes, asking questions such as “Tell me about the <strong>last time you searched for information</strong> on your research topic,” and “Can you think of a situation when you were <strong>unable to find information</strong> you were looking for?” We also observed the participants as they worked.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top:32px;">Participants Interviewed</h4>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 0;">1</span>business &amp; economics librarian</p>

          <br>
          <p>All interviewees signed consent forms.</p>

          <h3>Interpretation Session</h3>
          <p>We then met for 6 hours as a team and utilized Karen Holtzblatt’s techniques to recount the interviews, note down key findings, and create <strong>sequence-flow models</strong> for each interviewee.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top:32px;">Primary Pain Points for Academics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Difficult to be aware of <strong>hundreds of databases and resources</strong>, which are variable in quality and usability</li>
            <li>Specific papers are difficult to find because Google <strong>does not sort by field</strong></li>
            <li>Important information can be missed if <strong>proper search terms</strong> are not used</li>
            <li><strong>News aggregators</strong> do not usually provide enough information</li>
            <li>Some databases do not allow the user to <strong>download information</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Storing and organizing</strong> all sources is a tedious process</li>

          <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
          <p>Taking our 150+ notes, we began to group them into affinity clusters. We then conducted a<strong>"walk-the-wall"</strong> activity where each team member added questions, insights, or design ideas to the affinity wall.</p>

          <h3>Consolidated Models</h3>
          <p>We then combined our individual sequence-flow models into a <strong>consolidated sequence-flow model</strong>, including all primary stakeholders and tools in the process. We also envisioned a <strong>future sequence-flow model</strong>, depicting a more ideal scenario based on our insights and design ideas.</p>

            <li>For crowd-sourced paper summaries, interviewees liked that it would <strong>save them time</strong></li>
            <li>However, they felt that the <strong>summaries would need to be very specific</strong> to be useful&mdash;responding to specific research questions, for example</li>
            <li>General paper summaries can already be found in evidence-based reviews and peer reviews</li>
            <li>Strong interest in the idea of having <strong>weekly summaries</strong> of news and latest papers</li>
            <li>Some tools already address identified needs, but perhaps not reliably enough for researchers to ubiquitously adapt</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy</strong> is a concern in sharing research information with colleagues</li>

      <!-- SECTION 5 - FINAL PROPOSAL -->
      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Final Proposal: uResearch</h2>
          <p><span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold;margin-right:4px;">uResearch</span> is an all-in-one research tool that provides academics with connections to colleagues and content they need at the time they need it.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized <strong>searching, organizing, and sharing</strong> of papers</li>
            <li>Browse and save links from a variety of academic resources such as JSTOR, ACM, and more.</li>
            <li>Search for papers based on field, conference, author, keyword</li>
            <li>Add tags to papers</li>
            <li><strong>Customized weekly newsletters</strong> of latest news, papers, and research findings in topic of interest</li>
            <li><strong>Private forums</strong> to initiate discussions and potentially forge <strong>collaboration and co-authorships</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Why will it address the need?</strong></p>
          <p>A central location that can both retrieve and store information will reduce the number of sites that academics need to visit when conducting research, making their workflow more efficient.</p>
          <p>Because researchers already use many online resources to conduct their research (e.g. Google Scholar) and to store and categorize papers (e.g. Mendeley), having an online tool that combines these two processes should be easy for researchers to adopt.</p>

          <h3>Final Poster Presentation to Client</h3>
          <p>At the end of this project, we created a final report and presented our concept to the client uReveal.</p>
