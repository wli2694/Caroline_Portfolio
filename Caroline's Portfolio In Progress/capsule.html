          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>The Simon Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University presented us with a problem statement: “Undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon possess great technical skills but struggle overall with soft skills such as <strong>communication and leadership</strong>.”</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>How might we design a <strong>service that enhances writing, reflection, and leadership skills</strong> in students at CMU?</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - RESEARCH -->
      <div class="projectgray">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>As a team we sought to understand the current problem space from <strong>multiple stakeholders’ perspectives</strong> and discover the strategies and <strong>trends at other universities</strong>.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:24px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 30px;">11</span>universities analyzed</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 30px;">16</span>stakeholders interviewed</p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>We started with internet research and an ecosystem dump of our undergraduate experiences to examine how other universities promote communication skills and identify gaps and opportunities.</p>
          <div class="row" style="margin-top:0;">
            <div class="half">
              <ul style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">

                <li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
                <li>Olin College</li>
                <li>Princeton University</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="half">
              <ul style="margin:0;">

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>We found that while almost all universities, including CMU, utilized curriculum requirements and communication centers, many also had an <strong>"x-factor" initiative</strong> that promoted student communication skills in unique ways. For example&mdash;<strong>student conferences</strong> to share personal projects and work, a 1-month <strong>no-class period for exploring interests</strong>, and <strong>cultural and humanities initiatives</strong>.</p>
          <p>We found that <strong>CMU was generally lacking in this "x-factor."</strong>

          <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
          <p>We sought to gather insights and opinions on communication at CMU. How do students and faculty at CMU feel about communication skills? How are students currently gaining communication skills?</p>

              <h4>Initial Interview Findings</h4>
              <p>Faculty understand communication is important but <strong>prioritize other skills and requirements first</strong>. Generally, students have <strong>little enthusiasm</strong> for the courses actually focused on writing and communication.</p>
              <p>Students therefore gain communication skills primarily via <strong>extracurricular activities and student-to-student interaction</strong>, not schoolwork.</p>

              <h4>Directed Storytelling Findings</h4>
              <p>Being primarily focused on graduation requirements, <strong>advising at CMU</strong> does little to help students with understanding what soft skills are important and how to develop these skills to achieve personal goals.</p>

              <p>Students are overwhelmed by the <strong>multitude of advisors</strong> they need to coordinate with over short time periods&mdash;15 minutes per session.</p>
              <p>Overall, the formal advising process for CMU undergraduates is <strong>short, fragmented, and highly dependent on student initative</strong>.</p>

              <h4>Informal Advising Service Model</h4>

          <div class="callout" style="margin-bottom:32px;">

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>Based on the opportunity area identified, we generated <strong>18 ideas</strong> to encourage communication skills in the realm of formal and informal advising.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Storyboarding &amp; Concept Evaluation</h3>
          <p>After professor and class feedback, we narrowed our ideas down to 6 concepts which we sketched out as storyboards.</p>

          </div>

          <h4 style="margin-top:32px;">6 Final Concepts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Course &amp; Activity Explorer</strong>: tags based on topics and skills covered</li>
            <li><strong>Advisor Scheduling &amp; Notetaking System</strong>: helps advisors organize and recall student info</li>
            <li><strong>Alumni Data Resource</strong>: provides info on courses taken and current jobs of alumni</li>
            <li><strong>Roadmap of Resources</strong>: provides just-in-time resources as students need them</li>
            <li><strong>Interclass Advising Groups</strong>: students assigned to "teams" that act as support network</li>
            <li><strong>Student Reflections</strong>: students answer questions about goals and values before advising sessions</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 style="margin-top:32px;">Key Findings from Concept Evaluation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students want to have <strong>one centralized source</strong> for resources and advising.</li>
            <li>Students and advisors <strong>do not want a system that sets a rigid path</strong> or prevents students from exploring.</li>
            <li>An advisor scheduling system and alumni data resource may already be in the works.</li>
            <li><strong>Advisors have busy schedules</strong> and cannot easily take on large amounts of work.</li>
            <li>Advisors want to <strong>optimize their time to really help students</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflections</strong> could be very helpful in facilitating more productive conversations with advisors.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Selecting Our Final Concept</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom:32px;">A <strong>culture of reflection</strong> will allow students to better decide their own priorities, values, life goals, and desired experiences. We believe that this will support a CMU where being a leader, sharing personal stories with others, and articulating what matters most is part of the common social fabric, shared by students, faculty, staff, and other stakeholders.</p>

          <p><span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold;margin-right:4px;">Capsule</span> is an online platform for students to <strong>reflect, explore, and share personal insights</strong> throughout their college experience.</p>
          <h3>Components</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Reflection Journal</strong>: students complete interactive and thought-provoking activities such as selecting their core values or creating different 5-year plans</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Platform</strong>: students share their reflections with their advisors, family, and friends and obtain feedback if desired</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Art Installation</strong>: data installation on campus allows the entire CMU community to experience student reflections as they happen on Capsule</li>

      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>To improve our design, we would further develop details on the <strong>touchpoints</strong> of Capsule and how they would be operationalized. For example, the reflection journal activities could be created by individual advisors or the Deans of individual departments. Students may access Capsule through another frequently used CMU website, such as SIO (course registration system).</p>

          <p>Overall, this project allowed me to experience the <strong>complexity of service design</strong>. There are so many factors and people that need to be considered. With pros and cons to every idea, it is extremely difficult to ideate and decide on one concept that is most promising.</p>
