          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>The Simon Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University presented us with a problem statement: “Undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon possess great technical skills but struggle overall with soft skills such as communication and leadership.”</p>

            <p>How can we design a service that enhances writing, reflection, and leadership skills in students at CMU?</p>

              <h4>Initial Interview Findings</h4>
              <p>Faculty understand communication is important but prioritize other skills and requirements first.</p>
              <p>Students therefore gain communication skills primarily via extracurricular activities and student-to-student interaction, not schoolwork.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Focusing primarily on requirements for graduation, advising at CMU leaves little time for issues such as helping students understand what they want to do with their lives after CMU, what skills are needed for their future, and how to develop those skills.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>What if advising at CMU focused on students’ goals and the big picture instead of simply graduating, the lowest standard?</p>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - IDEATION -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>Based on the opportunity area identified, we generated 18 ideas in the realm of formal and informal advising.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="third">
              <img src="images/capsule/persona.png" alt="persona" class="projectimg">

              <h4>Personas</h4>
              <p>We created 5 personas to facilitate ideation and keep the original goals in mind.</p>

            <div class="twothird">
              <h4>Opportunities &amp; Concepts</h4>
              <p>We then clustered the ideas by theme and created a report describing the 9 best concepts.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Storyboarding &amp; Concept Evaluation</h3>
          <p>After professor and class feedback, we narrowed our ideas down to 6 concepts which we sketched out as storyboards.</p>

          <h4>6 Final Concepts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Course &amp; Activity Explorer: tags based on topics and skills covered</li>
            <li>Advisor Scheduling &amp; Notetaking System: helps advisors organize and recall student info</li>
            <li>Alumni Data Resource: provides info on courses taken and current jobs of alumni</li>
            <li>Roadmap of Resources: provides just-in-time resources as students need them</li>
            <li>Interclass Advising Groups: students assigned to "teams" that act as support network</li>
            <li>Student Reflections: students answer questions about goals and values before advising sessions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We tested our concepts via speed-dating with 4 faculty advisors, 5 undergraduate students, and 1 alumni.</p>

          <img src="images/capsule/storyboards.png" alt="storyboards" class="projectimg">

          <h4>Key Findings from Concept Evaluation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students want to have one centralized place for resources and advising.</li>
            <li>Students and advisors do not want a system that sets a rigid path or prevents students from exploring.</li>
            <li>Advisors have busy schedules and cannot easily take on large amounts of work.</li>
            <li>Advisors want to optimize their time to really help students.</li>
            <li>An advisor scheduling system and alumni data resource may already be in the works.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Selecting Our Final Concept</h3>
          <p>A culture of reflection will allow students to better decide their own priorities, values, life goals, and desired experiences. We believe that this will support a CMU where being a leader, sharing your story with others, and articulating what matters most is part of the common social fabric, shared by students, faculty, staff, and other stakeholders.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 4 - FINAL PROPOSAL -->
      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Final Proposal: Capsule</h2>
          <p>Capsule is an online platform for students to reflect, explore, and share personal insights throughout their college experience. </p>

          <h3>Components</h3>
          <p>1. Reflection Journal: students complete interactive and thought-provoking activities such as selecting their core values or creating different 5-year plans</p>
          <p>2. Communication Platform: for students to share their reflections with their advisors, family, and friends and obtain feedback if desired</p>
          <p>3. Interactive Art Installation: data installation on campus that allows the entire CMU community to experience student reflections as they happen on Capsule</p>

          <h3>Final Presentation &amp; Video</h3>
          <p>For our final presentation, we created an animated stop-motion video that shares a narrative about the interaction a student would have with Capsule.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 5 - CLOSING -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Thoughts &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>To improve our design, we would further develop details on the touchpoints of Capsule and how they would be operationalized. For example, the reflection journal activities could be created by individual advisors or the Deans of individual departments. Students may access Capsule through another frequently used CMU website, such as SIO (course registration system).</p>

          <p>Overall, this was a great intro into the complexity of service design. There are so many factors and people that need to be considered. With pros and cons to every idea, it is extremely difficult to ideate and decide on one concept that is most promising.</p>
