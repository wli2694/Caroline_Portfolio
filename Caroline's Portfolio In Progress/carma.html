          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p><strong>Tweens want to be independent</strong>, but they have a lifetime of parents making all of the arrangements and taking on all responsibilities. Parents want their children to take responsibility for their own social events, but also want to stay in control of what their children do, where they go, and who they are with.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>How might we design a mobile app that allows <strong>tweens to begin to take ownership</strong> in setting up their own social activities?</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Understanding Personas</h3>
          <p>For this project, 2 personas were provided: Aya the tween and Kaylee her mom. These personas were later utilized in ideating design solutions and creating scenarios and storyboards.</p>

          <h3>Ecosystem Dump</h3>
          <p>Our first step was to <strong>explore our current knowledge</strong> about tween and parent coordination of social activities and determine areas of uncertainty.</p>

          <h3>Guerilla Research</h3>
          <p>From the ecosystem dump and personas provided, we developed a list of questions and created interview guides to conduct some quick guerilla research.</p>

          <br>
          <h4>Key Interview Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Texting</strong> is the most common and efficient medium of keeping in touch between parents and tweens</li>
            <li>The most popular apps among tweens are <strong>SnapChat and Instagram</strong></li>
            <li>Many plans tweens make are <strong>last minute</strong> — they often assume parents are free</li>
            <li>Last minute planning is <strong>stressful for parents</strong> as they have to shuffle things around or say no to kids</li>
            <li>Parents want their kids to be <strong>independent</strong> and coordinate their own social activities. However, parents also want to <strong>stay in control</strong></li>
            <li>Parents must know <strong>who kids are with and where they are</strong> — location must be safe or supervised</li>
            <li><strong>Permission is not equal to transportation</strong></li>
            <!-- <li>Parents need to be involved to resolve conflicts and provide transportation.</li> -->
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Tweens <strong>need transportion</strong> to socialize, but parents often <strong>do not have time or desire</strong> to drive or coordinate logistics.</p>
          </div>

      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - IDEATION -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>As a team, we met and brainstormed a wide range of design solutions utilizing bodystorming and reframing.</p>

          <img src="images/carma/ideation.png" alt="ideation on whiteboard" class="projectimg">

          <h3>Exploratory Scenarios</h3>
          <p>From 25 ideas, we selected and further developed 5 concepts.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Social Planning App</strong>: contains calendar of events and suggests activities for tweens or times when parents are available</li>
            <li><strong>Public Transit Simulation Day</strong>: to increase parents’ comfort about sending kids on public transit</li>
            <li><strong>“Fill In For Me” Social Exchange for Moms</strong>: moms share workload of driving tweens</li>
            <li><strong>“Uber for Minors”</strong>: pool of approved drivers in the community on standby to help transport tweens</li>
            <li><strong>Driverless Cars for Minors</strong>: parents can track and communicate with driverless cars that transport tweens</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Storyboarding &amp; Concept Evaluation</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="half">
              <p>As our team continued to discuss different ideas, we discovered an underlying theme: <strong>tween’s parents need not necessarily be the ones to drive or coordinate</strong>.</p>
              <p>Instead, there can be a pool of trusted drivers for minors who transport tweens in exchange for credits. We presented the 3 most promising scenarios as storyboards to our class to elicit feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="half">
              <img src="images/carma/storyboard3.png" alt="storyboard" class="projectimg">
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>In-Class Design Critique</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Exchanging money or credits for rides seems <strong>too transactional</strong> and may lead to <strong>awkward social encounters</strong></li>
            <li>Generally, the concepts are missing the aspect of <strong>parental oversight and permission</strong></li>
            <li>Parents must <strong>approve the social event first</strong> — before transportation is even considered</li>
            <li>Most parents do not currently feel comfortable with sending their tween in a driverless car</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Re-Thinking Stakeholder Value</h3>
          <p>From the critique, our challenges were to find a way to <strong>remove the transactional aspect</strong> of our concepts and <strong>maintain parental oversight</strong>, but still provide value to all parties including the tween, parent, and driver.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Perhaps the app can utilize <strong>“social currency” instead of money or points</strong> to encourage social responsibility in tweens and the community. As tweens do good deeds for members of the community, other parents and trusted drivers can chip in to help transport them.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold;margin-right:4px;">Carma</span> is a mobile app that allows tweens to get rides from pre-approved drivers in the community such as friends’ parents, family friends, and sibilings in exchange for donig good deeds and chores for these drivers.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Provides transportation</strong> for tweens</li>
                <li><strong>Incentivizes</strong> drivers by letting them request favors or help with chores</li>
                <li><strong>Encourages tweens to take responsibility</strong> by doing good deeds and thus building “carma”</li>
                <li><strong>Parents stay in control</strong> by approving the trip details and good deeds</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="twothird">
              <h4>Tween's View</h4>
              <p>The goal for the tween’s view was to create a simple design that focused on two major functions of <strong>requesting rides</strong> and <strong>adding good deeds</strong>.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="row">

              <h4>Parent's View</h4>
              <p>For the parent’s view the major goal was to allow the parent to have <strong>flexibility and control</strong>. Therefore, we decided to have a tabbed view where the parent can quickly jump between their tween’s <strong>trip requests</strong>, <strong>record of good deeds</strong>, and <strong>list of approved drivers</strong>.</p>

          <h3>High-Fidelity Visual Design</h3>
          <p>For inspiration, we began by exploring the visual design of existing apps popular among tweens, such as SNapChat, Instagram, Spotify, and musical.ly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top:24px;">Motion Design</h4>
          <p>To introduce <strong>delight</strong> into our design, we animated a fluid at the bottom of the screen that represents “carma”. The fluid level increases as the tween does more good deeds.</p>

          <h3>Final Pitch &amp; Demo</h3>
          <p>For our final pitch to the class and professors, we focused on the story of the personas, utilizing drama and emphasizing that there are <strong>untapped resources</strong>; parents do not always have to be the ones to drive. Carma coordinates with other approved drivers to <strong>ease the workload on parents</strong> and <strong>cultivate a sense of responsibility in tweens</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Thoughts &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>While our audience of college students seemed to connect with the tween’s point of view more, it would make for a more powerful pitch if we centered our story around the parent’s challenges as most investors would relate more to this age-group. Additionally, the primary pain points affect the parents, not the tweens.</p>
          <p>In a future iteration, it would be best to <strong>focus on the parents as the primary user</strong> and further develop the user experience for the <strong>third user group: drivers</strong>.</p>
