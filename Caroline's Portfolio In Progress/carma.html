          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>Tweens want to be independent, but they have a lifetime of parents making all of the arrangements and taking on all responsibilities. Parents want their children to take responsibility for their own social events, but parents also want to control what their children do, where they go, and who they are with.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>Design a mobile app that allows tweens to begin to take ownership in setting up their own playdates with other tweens. Parents need to be involved to resolve conflicts and provide transportation.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Understanding Personas</h3>
          <p>For this project, 2 personas were provided: Aya the tween and Kaylee her mom. These personas were later utilized in ideating design solutions and creating scenarios and storyboards.</p>

              <p>Aya is a 7th grader who loves theater and hanging out with friends. She is proactive in initiating plans with friends and would use Uber if she could.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Our first step was to explore our current knowledge about tween and parent coordination of social activities and determine areas of uncertainty.</p>

          <div class="half">

            <h4>Actors</h4>

          <h3>Guerilla Research</h3>
          <p>From the ecosystem dump and personas provided, we developed a list of questions and created interview guides to conduct some quick guerilla research.</p>
          <p>4 high school freshman</p>
          <p>2 parents of tweens</p>
          <p>1 7th grader</p>

          <img src="images/carma/guerillaresearch.png" alt="guerilla research" class="projectimg">

          <h4>Key Interview Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Many plans tweens make are last minute — they often assume parents are free</li>
            <li>Last minute planning is stressful for parents as they have to shuffle things around or say no to kids</li>
            <li>Permission is not equal to transportation</li>
            <li>Parents want their kids to be independent and coordinate their own social activities</li>
            <li>However, parents also want to stay in control</li>
            <li>Parents must know who kids are with and where they are — location must be safe or supervised</li>
            <li>Texting is the most common and efficient medium of keeping in touch between parents and tweens</li>
            <li>The most popular app among tweens are SnapChat and Instagram</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Tweens need transportion to socialize, but parents often do not have time or desire to drive or coordinate logistics.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - IDEATION -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>As a team, we met and brainstormed a wide range of design solutions utilizing bodystorming and reframing.</p>

          <img src="images/carma/ideation.png" alt="ideation on whiteboard" class="projectimg">

          <h3>Exploratory Scenarios</h3>
          <p>From 25 ideas, we selected and further developed 5 concepts.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Social Planning App: contains calendar of events and suggests activities for tweens or times when parents are available</li>
            <li>Public Transit Simulation Day: to increase parents’ comfort about sending kids on public transit</li>
            <li>“Fill In For Me” Social Exchange for Moms: moms share workload of driving tweens</li>
            <li>“Uber for Minors”: pool of approved drivers in the community on standby to help transport tweens</li>
            <li>Driverless Cars for Minors: parents can track and communicate driverless cars that transport tweens</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Storyboarding &amp; Concept Evaluation</h3>
          <p>As our team continued to discuss different ideas, we discovered an underlying theme: tween’s parents need not necessarily be the ones to drive or coordinate. Instead, there can be a pool of trusted drivers for minors who transport tweens in exchange for credits. We presented the 3 most promising scenarios as storyboards to our class to elicit feedback.</p>

          <img src="images/carma/storyboard3.png" alt="storyboard" class="projectimg">

          <h4>In-Class Design Critique</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Exchanging money or credits for rides seems too transactional and may lead to awkward social encounters</li>
            <li>Generally, the concepts are missing the aspect of parental oversight and permission</li>
            <li>Parents must approve the social event first — before transportation is considered</li>
            <li>Most parents do not currently feel comfortable with sending their tween in a driverless car</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Re-Thinking Stakeholder Value</h3>
          <p>From the critique, our challenge was to find a way to remove the transactional aspect of our concepts but still provide value to all parties including the tween, parent, and driver.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Perhaps the app can utilize “social currency” instead of money or points and encourage social responsibility in tweens and the community.</p>
          </div>

      <!-- SECTION 4 - FINAL PROPOSAL -->
      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Final Proposal: Carma</h2>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="third">
              <img src="images/carma/carmainterface.png" alt="carma interface" class="projectimg">
            </div>
            <div class="twothird">
              <p>Carma is a mobile app that allows tweens to get rides from pre-approved drivers in the community such as friends’ parents, family friends, and sibilings in exchange for donig good deeds and chores for these drivers.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Provides transportation for tweens</li>
                <li>Incentivizes drivers by letting them request favors or help with chores</li>
                <li>Encourages tweens to take responsibility by doing good deeds and thus building “carma”</li>
                <li>Parents stay in control by approving the trip details and good deeds</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Navigational Maps</h3>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="third">
              <img src="images/carma/tweennavmap.png" alt="tween navigational map" class="projectimg">
            </div>
            <div class="twothird">
              <p>The goal for the tween’s view was to create a simple design that focused on two major functions of requesting rides and adding good deeds.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="third">
              <img src="images/carma/parentnavmap.png" alt="parent navigational map" class="projectimg">
            </div>
            <div class="twothird">
              <p>For the parent’s view the major goal was to allow the parent to have flexibility and control. Therefore, we decided to have a tabbed view where the parent can quickly jump between their tween’s trip requests, record of good deeds, and list of approved drivers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>High-Fidelity Visual Design</h3>
          <p>For inspiration, we began by exploring the visual design of existing apps popular among tweens, such as SNapChat, Instagram, Spotify, and musical.ly.</p>

          <h4>Iteration on Parent's Landing Screen</h4>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Motion Design</h4>
          <p>To introduce delight into our design, we animated a fluid at the bottom of the screen that acts as “carma”. The fluid level increases as the tween does more good deeds.</p>

          <h3>Final Pitch &amp; Demo</h3>
          <p>For our final pitch to the class and professors, we focused on the story of the personas, utilizing drama and emphasizing that there are untapped resources; parents do not always have to be the ones to drive. Carma coordinates with other approved drivers to ease the workload on parents and cultivate a sense of responsibility in tweens.</p>

      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Thoughts &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>While our audience of college students seemed to connect with the tween’s point of view more, it would make for a more powerful pitch if we centered our story around the parent’s challenges as most investors would relate more to this age-group. Additionally, the primary pain points affect the parents, not the tweens.</p>
          <p>In a future iteration, it would be best to focus on the parents as the primary user and further develop the user experience for the third user group: drivers.</p>
