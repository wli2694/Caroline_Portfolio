          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>Design a mobile timebank iPhone application that allows people to trade an hour of their skills and expertise for an hour of another personâ€™s skills and expertise.</p>

          <p>This project was a great opportunity to practice skills such as sketching and brainstorming ideas, wireframing, user testing, collecting feedback, creating mock-ups and a prototype using Balsamiq Mockups, Sketch 3, and InvisionApp. Overall it was a fun experience in which I learned a lot.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - Sketching -->
      <div class="projectgray">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Sketching</h2>
          <p>First I developed different ideas and sketched conceptual models of how to display more or less time. I also sketched ideas for discoverability within the app. I then sketched wireframes of the user interface for the app as well as user interactions.</p>

          <h3>Conceptual Models</h3>

      <!-- SECTION 3 - USER TESTING -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p>Subsequently, I observed and interviewed 3 people interacting with the sketched wireframes I created. I collected and recorded this feedback.</p>

          <p>Notes: Profile photos will make the app more personal. Have purchases and requests on two separate tabs to be less confusing. Include words below menu icons to make them more clear. Add a confirmation page for completed trades.</p>

          <h3>Med-Fi Prototyping Using Balsamiq Mockups</h3>
          <p>I improved the wireframes based on the user testing and feedback and built digital mockups using Balsamiq Mockups.</p>

          <h3>Hi-Fi Visual Design</h3>
          <p>After additional testing and feedback, I created UI designs for the app using Sketch. I also added interactivity to the prototype with InvisionApp.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 5 - CONCLUSION -->
      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>From evaluating my design with others, I learned that people of different generations and knowledge level interpret designs differently. It is important to make graphics and words as clear and concise as possible. In future iterations I would want to add a history function to view previous transactions, a menu for looking at categories of skills, and a menu for sorting skills by date posted, rating, most reviews, and cost.</p>
