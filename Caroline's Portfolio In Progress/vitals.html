          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <!-- <p>The goal of this project was to <strong>redesign the portal web application for medical students</strong> to be able to effectively and efficiently manage their coursework and required tasks.</p> -->

          <p>The goal of the this project was to support the VITALS Integration Team in redesigning <strong>VITALS, a web application that medical students use</strong> to view their daily schedule, grades, and academic status, access lecture slides and notes, and complete forms and evaluations. It is basically the <strong>central portal</strong> for medical students.</p>
          <p>To gain design experience, I volunteered to help out with the design process a few hours a week. The team consisted of a project manager and 3 developers. As a <strong>former medical student</strong> who used VITALS on a daily basis, I also had a lot of insight into the user’s perspective and the existing pain points and useful features within VITALS.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 - RESEARCH -->
      <div class="projectgray">

          <h2>Understanding Students' Goals and Needs</h2>
          <p>First, I spoke with <!-- Dr. Danforth, --><strong>the curriculum program director</strong>, about the general purpose of VITALS and specific requirements or desired features. I then considered my own usage of VITALS and created documents highlighting the <strong>primary usability issues</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Evaluation of Interface</h3>

          <h3>Gathering User Feedback</h3>

            <div class="half">
                <p>Additionally, I surveyed <strong>5 medical students</strong> about their experiences with VITALS. I also thought about my own experience and aspects I found frustrating</p>

      <div class="projectwhite">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Creating Wireframes and Mockups</h2>
          <p>Next I created <strong>wireframes and a medium-fidelity mockup</strong> while considering the users’ comments and my own thoughts. I combined these along with the student feedback and sent them to the team.</p>

          <h3>Meeting with the Team</h3>
          <p>I then met with the other team members and discussed challenges and ideas. I discovered issues such as <strong>inadequate resources, compensation, and time</strong> for the team members. We discussed the next steps and decided that I would look through additional user feedback from the VITALS e-mail and come up with a few other ideas for the team to discuss and compare.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 4 - CONCLUSION -->
      <div class="projectblue">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>As a former medical student at OSU who experienced the <strong>daily stress of having hundreds of articles to read, assignments to do, quizzes, and required events and training</strong>, I knew that the student portal was extremely vital (probably why it is called "VITALS"). It was supposed to be the central location for everything med student-related. However, I often felt <strong>frustrated and overwhelmed by VITALS</strong>. I think having this first-hand experience of being a user gave me a lot of ideas for how VITALS could be improved.</p>

          <p>However, since I had little time for this role as a volunteer, and the team members were also limited on time and resources, the overall design process was very minimal. I <strong>would have liked to spend more time interviewing medical students and observing them using VITALS</strong> to see other points of view and better understand how to improve the overall user experience.</p>
