          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a chronic illness that accounts for between 5% and 10% of all diabetes cases. It is often first diagnosed in childhood, and about 80,000 children develop the disease each year.</p>

            <p>How can we uitlize co-design to create concepts that will improve the lives of those living with T1D?</p>

      <div class="projectgray">
        <div class="container">

          <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
          <p>Our first step was to conduct interviews to better understand the values, goals, and pain points of our primary user group: academic researchers.</p>
          <p>23 academic papers reviewed</p>
          <p>7 experts consulted</p>
          <p>4 patients with T1D interviewed</p>
          <p>1 Diabetes School Navigator interviewed</p>
          <p>1 expert interviewed</p>

          <h3>Learning from the Experts</h3>
          <p>Several experts came to our class to provide education and insights about the challenges and frustrations of living with T1D and providing care to patients with T1D. We additionally read through 23 academic papers on Type 1 Diabetes to develop our knowledge on the topic.</p>

          <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>endocrinologist from OSUWMC</li>
            <li>president of the OSU College Diabetes Network who also lives with T1D</li>
            <li>representatives from Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. Diabetes Care</li>
            <li>physician and head of the T1DM Transitions Clinic at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital</li>
            <li>pediatrician and Director of the Center for Public Health Practice at OSU</li>
            <li>diabetes educator who also lives with T1D</li>

            <div class="twothird">
              <p>As a class, we mapped out the primary stakeholders involved with Type 1 Diabetes, grouping them into the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>patient &amp; immediate circle of care (friends, family)</li>
                <li>school &amp; work</li>
                <li>government &amp; insurance companies</li>
                <li>health care workers</li>
                <li>medical device companies &amp; the food industry</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Our team decided to focus on the school & work category, with the goal of designing a solution that can help schools and workplaces better support students and employees with Type 1 Diabetes.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Patient Experience</h2>

          <h3>Workshop with College Diabetes Network</h3>
          <p>A few team members attended a CDN meeting and conducted a mini workshop. Each CDN member was asked to come up with 3 or 4 ideas, themes, or challenges relating to T1D that they hoped we would be able to explore on this project. Below is a summary of key findings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confusion between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes — often leads to public misconceptions and other psychological impacts</li>
            <li>Lack of education in the general public about T1D and how to support people with T1D</li>
            <li>Training process for T1D medical devices is not fun, engaging, or memorable</li>
            <li>Transition from pediatrics to adult care often lacks support or guidance</li>
            <li>Circles of care for T1D patients are disconnected</li>
            <li>Mental health issues more common amongst people living with T1D</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Type 1 diabetes never stops. 24/7 management is stressful and exhausting for patients.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Patient Interviews</h3>
          <p>We recruited 4 students from the CDN to interview to better understand their experiences and challenges. To facilitate the interview, we provided a paper timeline, cut-out icons, images, markers, and tape to allow participants to map out key positive and negative experiences in their life related to their diabetes.</p>

          <h4>Key Interview Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Biggest limitation in school is sports — troublesome to stop and check blood sugar</li>
            <li>Teens feel ashamed when they don’t manage their diabetes perfectly</li>
            <li>Diabetes camp is one very positive experience that allows kids with diabetes to feel more comfortable</li>
            <li>Overall, there is a lack of support and understanding for Type 1 diabetes patients</li>
            <li>Confusion between Type 1 and Type 2 leads to people judging and blaming T1D patients for getting their disease</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Immersion Experience</h3>
          <p>To better understand the experience of living with T1D, our team spent a week using various devices that patients with diabetes use. I spent a week wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on my abdomen. I was able to experience first-hand the difficulty of counting carbs and insulin for every bit of food, pricking my finger several times a day, and enduring the irritation of the monitor on my skin 24/7. I can imagine that it must be very overwhelming especially when patients are first diagnosed as children.</p>

          <h2>Thoughts &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>While our audience of college students seemed to connect with the tween’s point of view more, it would make for a more powerful pitch if we centered our story around the parent’s challenges as most investors would relate more to this age-group. Additionally, the primary pain points affect the parents, not the tweens.</p>
          <p>In a future iteration, it would be best to focus on the parents as the primary user and further develop the user experience for the third user group: drivers.</p>
