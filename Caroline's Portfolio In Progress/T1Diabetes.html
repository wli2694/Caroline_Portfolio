          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p><strong>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)</strong> is a chronic illness that accounts for between 5% and 10% of all diabetes cases. It is often first diagnosed in childhood, and about 80,000 children develop the disease each year.</p>

        <div class="container">

          <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
          <p>Our initial research involved reviewing literature and consulting subject matter experts. We then conducted interviews.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 32px;">23</span>academic papers reviewed</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 32px;">7</span>experts consulted</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 32px;">4</span>patients with T1D interviewed</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 32px;">1</span>Diabetes School Navigator interviewed</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;margin: 0 12px 0 32px;">1</span>expert interviewed</p>

          <h3>Learning from the Experts</h3>
          <p>Several experts came to our class to provide education and insights about the challenges and frustrations of living with T1D and providing care to patients with T1D. We additionally read through 23 academic papers on Type 1 Diabetes to develop our knowledge on the topic.</p>

          <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>endocrinologist from OSUWMC</li>
            <li>president of the OSU College Diabetes Network who also lives with T1D</li>
            <li>representatives from Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. Diabetes Care</li>
            <li>physician and head of the T1DM Transitions Clinic at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital</li>
            <li>pediatrician and Director of the Center for Public Health Practice at OSU</li>
            <li>diabetes educator who also lives with T1D</li>

            <div class="twothird">
              <p>As a class, we mapped out the <strong>primary stakeholders</strong> involved with Type 1 Diabetes, grouping them into the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>patient &amp; immediate circle of care (friends, family)</li>
                <li>school &amp; work</li>
                <li>government &amp; insurance companies</li>
                <li>health care workers</li>

              </ul>
          </div>
          </div>

          <p>Our team decided to focus on the <strong>school &amp; work category</strong>, with the goal of designing a solution that can help schools and workplaces better support students and employees with Type 1 Diabetes.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Patient Experience</h2>

          <h3>Workshop with College Diabetes Network</h3>
          <p>A few team members attended a CDN meeting and conducted a mini workshop. Each CDN member was asked to come up with 3 or 4 <strong>ideas, themes, or challenges</strong> relating to T1D that they hoped we would be able to explore on this project. Below is a summary of key findings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confusion between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes</strong> — often leads to public misconceptions and other psychological impacts</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of education</strong> in the general public about T1D and how to support people with T1D</li>
            <li><strong>Training process</strong> for T1D medical devices is not fun, engaging, or memorable</li>
            <li><strong>Transition from pediatrics to adult care</strong> often lacks support or guidance</li>
            <li><strong>Circles of care</strong> for T1D patients are disconnected</li>
            <li><strong>Mental health issues</strong> more common amongst people living with T1D</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Type 1 diabetes never stops.</strong> 24/7 management is stressful and exhausting for patients.</p>
          </div>

              <p>We also recruited <strong>4 students from the CDN to interview</strong> to better understand their experiences and challenges.

            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Key Interview Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Biggest limitation in school is <strong>sports</strong> — troublesome to stop and check blood sugar</li>
            <li>Teens feel <strong>ashamed</strong> when they don’t manage their diabetes perfectly</li>
            <li><strong>Diabetes camp</strong> is one very positive experience that allows kids with diabetes to feel more comfortable</li>
            <li>Overall, there is a <strong>lack of support</strong> and understanding for Type 1 diabetes patients</li>
            <li><strong>Confusion between Type 1 and Type 2</strong> leads to people judging and blaming T1D patients for getting their disease</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Immersion Experience</h3>
          <p>To better understand the experience of living with T1D, our team spent a week using various devices that patients with diabetes use. I spent a week wearing a <strong>continuous glucose monitor (CGM)</strong> on my abdomen. Initially, I felt <strong>overwhelmed</strong> with learning how to use the device and remembering all of the steps. Insertion of the monitor was <strong>painful</strong>.</p>
          <p>During the week, it was interesting to be able to see how my blood glucose changed with various foods. The site became <strong>itchy,</strong> after a few days, and the adhesive started coming off. <strong>Most frustrating was the finger sticks</strong>. One was fine, but having to do multiple in a day was not fun, and I would get bruises on my finger. It also takes a lot of time and effort to track things like carbs and exercise. Overall, I can imagine that it must be very overwhelming especially when patients are first diagnosed as children and have to adjust to all of these changes.</p>

          <h2>Co-Design Workshop</h2>

          <h3>Planning &amp; Preparations</h3>
          <p>We decided that we would invite <strong>education and CDN students</strong> to come together and brainstorm their own ideas for improving the experience of elementary and middle school students with T1D and ways to impart education to teachers, nurses, and community members.</p>
          <p>We would provide all participants with a copy of <strong>Insuman</strong>, a fun comic that explains the experience of getting diagnosed with T1D in school.</p>

          <h4>Activity 1. Design a School</h4>
          <p>Each team will first be presented with a <strong>diagram of a school building</strong> and blocks representing various touchpoints (classroom, clinic, gym, etc.). They will use markers, paper, blocks, and other materials to design improvements at these touchpoints.</p>
          <h4>Activity 2. Implementation of Design</h4>
          <p>On a blank diagram of the <strong>socio-ecological circle</strong>, each team would then use markers and post-its to show how their design solutions impact each circle and what steps would need to be taken to make their solutions a reality.</p>

          <h3>Workshop Day</h3>
          <p>8 participants came out for our workshop, and we split them into two separate groups. <strong>Overall, it was quite a success!</strong> Participants were engaged and gave a lot of great insights. It was most challenging to make sure the activities were completed in our given timeframe.</p>

          <h4>Key Ideas from Participants</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase <strong>awarenesss</strong> of T1D to reduce stigma, bullying, and mixing it up with T2D</li>
            <li>Diabetes education should be <strong>incorporated into the curriculum</strong> (math, science, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Teachers</strong> should learn more about diabetes (e.g. through training) so they feel comfortable with having T1D children in their care</li>
            <li>Teachers that find success should <strong>share their ideas</strong> with other teachers</li>
            <li>There should be a <strong>dedicated RN</strong> for each school&mdash;often not the case</li>
            <li>Build <strong>strong communication</strong> between teacher, parent, student, and peers</li>
            <li>T1D child should be at the <strong>center of care</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Thoughts &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>While our audience of college students seemed to connect with the tween’s point of view more, it would make for a more powerful pitch if we centered our story around the parent’s challenges as most investors would relate more to this age-group. Additionally, the primary pain points affect the parents, not the tweens.</p>
          <p>In a future iteration, it would be best to focus on the parents as the primary user and further develop the user experience for the third user group: drivers.</p>
